Input data:
Transription of TFs for set of tissues (tissues x TF's, binary)
HPAS of TF's for the same set of TF's (tissues x TF's, binary)

Ontology of tissues, v 6 from FANTOM.  
https://fantom5-collaboration.gsc.riken.jp/files/data/shared/contrib/sample_ontology/FANTOM5v6/FANTOM5v6.obo.zip

Derivated data:
TF expression and HPAS (tissues x TF's, binary) logical elementwise and for TF expression and HPAS; TF Expression concatenated with HPAS (tissues x (2TF's)) - concatenated binary matrix

Pipeline:

a) Clustering
First, the tissues were clustered according to Manhattan distance inside each of the data matrices.
dendrogram_create.r, output includes 4 pdf files and Rda with all the dendrogarams.


b) Tests for correspondence of the dedrograms to the ontology.

First, the obo file was converted to incidence matrix (binary, tissuex x categories). The matrix represents the 'is-a' ontology relation, expanded by transitivity.

Then two tests were run for each category and each of the four dendrogams that represent differnt clusterings. 
i. Fisher's exact test for association of the category to the top-level fork of the tree.
ii. The same test for each fork in the tree was run recursevily, the result is the minimal p-value.

The results for each tree are represented in the corresponding file nane *.p-values.txt and *.p-values.resursive.txt. The files are sorted by p-value.
Rows are categories.

The results are also combined in p-values.txt and p-values.resursive.txt. tables. The files are sorted according to the minimal p-value of the category. Columns are: category ID, category name, the p-values for tests: HPAS, concatenated, and, transcription.
